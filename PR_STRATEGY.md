## Communication Plan

### Initial Outreach

Create an issue first to gauge interest:

```markdown
Title: Proposal: Enhanced insider analysis and cross-company search features

I've developed several enhancements for SEC EDGAR MCP that my team has been using successfully:

1. **Cross-company search**: Find all companies where a person is an insider
2. **Advanced Form 4 parsing**: Detailed transaction analysis with pattern detection
3. **13F institutional holdings**: Parse and track institutional positions
4. **Natural language interface**: "How many shares of X does Y own?"

These address the limitation that SEC's API requires company-specific queries by implementing full-text search across all filings.

Would you be interested in PRs for these features? I can split them into logical chunks for easier review.

```

### PR Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with PR 1 (utilities) to establish trust
2. **Be Responsive**: Address feedback quickly
3. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure all tests pass, follow project style
4. **Document Well**: Clear docstrings and usage examples
5. **Be Patient**: Large features may take time to review

## Alternative Approaches

If PRs aren't accepted or take too long:

1. **Maintain Public Fork**: Keep enhanced version available for community
2. **Create Plugin System**: Propose plugin architecture for extensions
3. **Separate Package**: Publish as `sec-edgar-mcp-enhanced` that extends base

## Timeline

- Week 1: Create issue, gauge interest
- Week 2: Submit PR 1 (utilities)
- Week 3-4: Submit PR 2 (insider tools) after PR 1 feedback
- Week 5+: Continue with remaining PRs based on response

## Success Metrics

- Community interest (issue reactions, comments)
- PR acceptance rate
- Feedback quality
- Usage by other developers

This strategic approach maximizes the chance of successful contribution while providing immediate value to our team through the fork.
